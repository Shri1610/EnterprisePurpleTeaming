<p align="center">Cybersecurity data breaches and incidents are costly and will continue to impact businesses and governments of all sizes. Cybersecurity leaders must embrace proactive cybersecurity strategies to protect organizations from data breaches. Many cybersecurity leaders are implementing purple teaming to better prepare their cybersecurity team, foster collaboration, test people, process, and technology, and progressively track the organization‚Äôs defenses to improve its security posture. Purple teaming from a high-level perspective refers to multiple security teams working together to improve an organization‚Äôs security posture. This research aims to explore how enterprise-level organizations are operationalizing purple teaming in security operation centers and provide cybersecurity leaders strategies to improve their security posture.</p>
